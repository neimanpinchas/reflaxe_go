# Reflaxe/Golang

A compiler that compiles Haxe code into Golang using [Reflaxe](https://github.com/RobertBorghese/reflaxe).

## Alternative Name
- **Go-sharp**: Once mature enough and easier to write than ancient Golang.

## Why Target GoLang?
- Great Performance vs. GC Balance
- Excellent Solid Tooling
- Faster Compilation than C++
- Truly Cross-Platform (Windows, Linux, BSD, WASM, AVR, etc.)
- Numerous Backend Libraries
- Collaboration with `go2hx`
- Static Binaries Easily Portable Between Distributions (Hardware Match Needed)
- Go Routines (Supports Haxe's Sync Nature)
- High-Speed Web Frameworks
- Real Readable Output

## How to Use
1. Ensure go 1.20 is installed (1.18 for generics, 1.20 for random generator)
2. Clone the repository using `haxelib`, or download locally and use with `haxelib/lix dev`.
3. Add a reference to the library: `-L reflaxe_go`.
4. Update the path to `go_imports.exe` in `Generator.hx` or define `-D goimports` in your HXML. (This is no longer required, it will install automatically, thanks to [commit](https://github.com/neimanpinchas/reflaxe_go/pull/2)) 
5. Add `-D go-output=haxe_out` (or any subfolder you like).
   - Note: Currently, it will not generate a Go main function. You must create a `main.go` in your Haxe root directory and call the necessary main function.
6. Add a matching `-D pkg=haxe_out`.
7. Run `haxe your.hxml`.

## Why Haxe+Golang > Golang
- Real Generics (Array Methods)
- String Interpolation
- Everything is an Expression
- Static Extensions
- Real Dynamics (When Needed)
- Pattern Matching
- Familiarity with EcmaScript (through JavaScript)
- Slim Client-Side Code Sharing (vs. Gopher/WASM)
- Enums: ADT
- Dynamic Methods
- Struct Field Initializers
## Derivations
- Support Class Blacklist via Config File
- Allow Explicit `goimports` via Meta
- `Json.parse` is Generic, Not Dynamic (Type Inferences) Currently there is aseperate class haxe.Json2, you can use it as `import haxe.Json2 as Json`
- Lang.go(()->{}) `to call as go routine`
- Supporting Multi-Return Like Lua

## Roadmap
- [ ] Full Reflection Support (Record-Macros and Typed JSON)
- [ ] Full Port of Networking Library
- [ ] Support Enums Reusing Same Parameter Name with Other Types
- [ ] Make Easier to Use (Update Documentation, Automatic Installation of `go_imports`, Automatic Main Creation, Use Defines for Package Name)
- [ ] Build a Beginner-Friendly Website for Golang Experts
- [ ] Implement full non sys std
- [ ] Implement full full sys.io.Fil and sys.FileSystem
- [ ] Implement full sys.net
- [ ] Implement full sys.db
- [ ] Implement full sys
- [ ] Unit tests

## Minor Bugs
- [ ] `smartDCE` Removes the Timer Class Even When Used

## Why
### Problem
Creating a successful compiler project is challenging due to the need for stability and widespread adoption. The complexity often leads to abandonment before reaching a usable state.

### Solution
Offer early commercial users the ability to advance the roadmap by contributing code or donations. In exchange, feature their names and corporations prominently on the project front page for future generations. Provide binary exponential leverage to early contributors (e.g., the first milestone finishers' names in 64pt font, the next in 32pt, etc.). Developers receive a commercial non-distributing usage license. Proposals for new milestones can be voted on by all current developers, and resolving 10 issues counts as a milestone. Once complete, the work will be released under a common open-source license (MIT, GPL, or similar) based on a developer vote and legal options.
